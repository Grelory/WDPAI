## Features
Quick Bill is the best ticket management application on the market. Users can buy tickets, view their available tickets, and check expired ones to keep track of their tickets usage efficiently. Administrators can manage the system by adding new providers, specifying locations, defining transport types, and creating ticket types with custom expiration times. This allows administrators to configure and maintain the systemâ€™s transportation options and ticketing rules, ensuring the system meets operational needs.
